===========

Recipes using BDG projects. Apache 2 licensed.

# Introduction

This repository is a home for "recipes" that use a [Big Data Genomics](http://bdgenomics.org)
project to accomplish some task. By default, these recipes use EC2 to create a Spark cluster,
on which we run ADAM/etc. These recipes serve three purposes:

* As a quickstart for people new to the BDG project, who would like to figure out how to use
BDG software to replace their current workflows.
* As a benchmarking/regression testing environment for the various BDG tools.
* As a sandbox where we can set up head-to-head tests against other tools (e.g., for experiments
for papers).
